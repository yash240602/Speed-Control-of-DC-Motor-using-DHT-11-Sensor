# Speed-Control-of-DC-Motor-using-DHT-11-Sensor
This project demonstrates a system to regulate the speed of a DC motor based on ambient temperature using a DHTI I sensor and an Arduino platform. The DHTII sensor measures the temperature, relaying data to the Arduino microcontroller, which interprets and processes this information.
